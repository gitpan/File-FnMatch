File/FnMatch version 0.01
=========================

File::FnMatch exposes your system's fnmatch(3) capabilities to Perl.
While considerably less powerful than regular expressions, shell-style
patterns are yet useful and familiar to a large audience of end-users.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
N.B.:  Some platforms, notably Win32, do not supply an fnmatch
       implementation.  This module will not build on those platforms.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Briefly:

   use File::FnMatch qw(:fnmatch);

   opendir(D, '.');
   while (my $fn = readdir(D)) {
     next unless fnmatch('*.exe', $fn, FNM_PERIOD|FNM_PATHNAME);
     ...
   }

INSTALLATION
